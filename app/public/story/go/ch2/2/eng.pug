p Despite the hunger pains, Go found [[go.self]] turning away from the smell toward the song. [[go.Sub]] stepped into an even larger hallway, the ceiling so high, [[go.sub]] had to squint to see it was a mural. Windows adorned with red curtains draped one side of it. Giant tapestries and golden doors covered the walls on the other. Go's mouth hung open and [[go.sub]] spun around while [[go.sub]] walked. [[go.Subwas]] not sure what to look at first. Or next. In fact, [[go.sub]] barely believed [[go.subwas]] looking at anything at all. This had to be some sort of dream or hallucination. Did [[go.sub]] swallow too much sea water?
p [[go.Sub]] finally reached the door from which the music came. It was wide open, and when Go stepped inside, [[go.sub]] had to force [[go.pos]] jaw to drop further. Just like the clothing store, this circular room was a book store, only ten -- no, twenty -- times the size. There must have been over a thousand bookshelves rising up the three stories. Ladders connected each level; railing lined the levels' edges. At the top of the room was a glass dome. At the center and main floor of the room were tables piled with pens, paper, boxes, packages, candles, and other shapes and contraptions Go had no words for.
p And there on the second level, was the source of the sound--a bronze organ with no player. But as Go squinted to confirm there was no one, the song stopped. Icy breath fell on [[go.pos]] neck. [[go.Sub]] jumped and spun around. There was no one there.
p A book on the table flipped open to an empty page. An ink vial beside it shivered. It tipped onto its side, splattering ink across the table. Go looked around. Still, there was no one. Patterns began to appear on the page -- words, perhaps a sentence. They formed a short line, then stopped. Carefully, Go slid toward it.
p [[go.Sub]] recognized some of the letters, but reading was never a hobby [[go.sub]] thought to pursue. And [[go.sub]] had a vague feeling that whatever was happening was supposed to be a message for [[go.obj]].
p "I'm sorry. I don't understand," [[go.sub]] said.
p New patterns appeared under the first message. Very different patterns from before, which [[go.sub]] only recognized as foreign.
p Go shook [[go.pos]] head. "No, I don't understand. I can't read very well. I've only ever drawn pictures."
p The book flopped shut.
p Go's stomach growled. [[go.Sub]] slapped [[go.pos]] hand over it and grinned. [[go.Sub]] forced a laugh.
p "I think I should go get food now. It was nice meeting you--whoever you are." Go turned toward the exit, [[go.pos]] heart racing.
p A gust of icy wind flew past [[go.obj]] and the door slammed shut. Panicking, Go bolted for the handles, but the moment [[go.sub]] touched them, frost burst from the locks. It spread across the door, it grew along the wall. The light from the dome window vanished. Candles lit up around the room. Vines twisted up along the ladders. The room began to shake. Books and ink fell from the tables. An eerie blue glow swirled around where [[go.sub]] stood, forming a giant circle etched into the floor. The light shot toward [[go.obj]] from twelve directions, slicing the circle into even pieces. Large symbols appeared one by one in each slice. The circle grew brighter. The vines grew thick and lush with leaves twice Go's size. The froze swelled into icicles.
p The door to the room flew open, Phi bursting in. [[go.Sub]] stomped [[go.pos]] foot at the edge of the circle, took a deep breath, and screeched so loud, the room continued to shake. Go clapped [[go.pos]] hands over [[go.pos]] ears and dropped to [[go.pos]] knees. The ice retracted. The vines shrunk. The books flew back in place. Beams of light broke through the window one by one. The circle vanished and the candles snuffed out.
p Go squinted up at Phi, who yanked the hem of [[go.pos]] shirt straight and nodded in contentment.
p "You're a terrible thief," said a voice at the door.
p And there was a new person standing in profile with [[teal.pos]] back against the door frame, a [[teal.child]] around Go's own age. [[teal.Sub]] had [[teal.pos]] hands deep in [[teal.pos]] sleeveless coat pockets and the sides of [[teal.pos]] hat drooped to [[teal.pos]] waist like a pair of dog ears.
p "I'm not a theft," Go said, jumping to [[go.pos]] feet. "There was just a song and suddenly the room went dark and..."
p The [[teal.child]] turned [[teal.pos]] full face toward [[go.obj]] and Go straightened. Half [[teal.pos]] face was missing. Not the kind of missing like it was mutated or lacking facial features--then again, [[go.sub]] could have described it as exactly that -- but it was a geode. From the top of [[go.pos]] head to the bottom of [[go.pos]] one-nostril nose, there was nothing but a hole aligned with blue-green crystals.
p "Huh?" [[teal.Sub]] said.
p [[go.Sub]] had to force [[go.self]] not to stare.
p "Maybe we can start over. Hi, my name is Go," [[go.sub]] said.
p "Fascinating," the [[teal.child]] said. "Come on. Let's get you back to Wisper."
p "Wait a second, that thing that happened. The vines and ice and books" -- [[go.sub]] pointed at the organ, unsure of what else could best represent something invisible--"what is that?"
p "An organ," the [[teal.child]] said.
p "No, I meant who was playing it." Go looked to Phi, who tilted [[phi.pos]] head.
p The [[teal.child]] shrugged. "Muses. What did you expect when you walked into a library?"
p Go continued to stare and slowly shook [[go.pos]] head.
p Sighing the [[teal.child]] shoved a thumb at Phi. "You know what [[phi.sub_is]], right?"
p Go lifted [[go.pospl]] chin, ready to nod. [[go.Sub]] didn't know anything but a name, but saying so would only cause more complications. [[go.Sub]] lowered [[go.pos]] chin. Sort of a yes.
p "But you don't know what muses are? Do you know what I am?"
p [[go.Sub]] shook [[go.pos]] head no.
p Moaning, the [[teal.child]] ran [[teal.pos]] fingers along [[teal.pos]] forehead, whipped off [[teal.pos]] hat to reveal a bald--if cracked-- head, and yanked [[teal.pos]] hat back on. Small specks of dust sparkled as they floated to the ground. [[teal.Sub]] turned on [[teal.pos]] heels and waltzed out of the room.
p Go ran after [[teal.obj]]. [[go.Sub]] grabbed [[teal.pos]] shoulder. "Hey!"
p Go found [[go.pos]] hand wrenched into the air. Phi was between them with [[phi.pos]] long fingers clamped around [[go.pos]] wrist. [[phi.Pos]] pupils twirled. The [[teal.child]] continued to walk, not fazed in the slightest.
p "Look, I can't help what I don't know, alright?" Go said. "All I know is I woke up this morning to a voice, and then there was something called a Kelper, and I was saved by a Taronian, except I wasn't really, which is why I was running away -- but no one seems to want to tell me anything that makes sense."
p "Jan's creatures can distort space and time to trap Pon's children in an alternative world while they feed off your existence. Ken's creations are the only thing that will save you. Running away from a Taronian is a terrible idea."
p "I still don't know what you're talking about."
p The [[teal.child]] stopped in [[teal.pos]] tracks, twirled on [[teal.pos]] heels, and shoved [[teal.pos]] finger toward a tapestry. "Jan!" [[teal.sub]] said, pointing to a massive figure of spiraling strips of cloth with an electric star in its heart. "Ken!" [[teal.sub]] said, pointing to an enormous bird with knife feathers and two large horns. "Pon!" [[teal.sub]] said, finishing at a large mountain with a glowing face and a spine of diamonds. "Or are the people of this island so hopelessly dense and isolated in your perfect little bubble, you don't even know who the gods are or care that our world is falling apart because they killed each other? Muses are Jan's creatures. They take over your mind, they lay their eggs as books or art or whatever they leech off you to make, and then they die -- like everything else -- and all you are is nothing but a hollow shell with no meaning or purpose until another muse finds you appealing enough to suck away even more of your life."
p "Teal, please!" Wisper said, standing at the edge of the hallway. "[[go.Subis]] a guest. I ask you to treat [[go.obj]] with the utmost respect. I brought [[go.obj]] here for you."
p "I didn't ask to come here and I didn't ask for a friend, especially a human one," the [[teal.child]] said. [[teal.Sub]] stomped past Wisper into a side room and slammed the door as [[teal.sub]] left.
p Sighing, Wisper massaged [[wisper.sub]] brow. "I'm sorry about [[teal.obj]]. We're going through a hard time right now."
p "I know how [[teal.sub]] feels though. We're just a fishing town," Go said. [[go.Sub]] glanced up at the tapestry of the alleged gods and scanned the whole hallway again. "Why did you come here of all places? I mean...you could probably buy a whole island to yourself if you wanted. There's nothing interesting here."
p "Funny you should say that," Wisper said, chuckling. "Teal was actually the island where my grandchildren lived."
p "Why didn't you go live with your grandchildren then? I'm sure they would have gotten along."
p Wisper lifted [[wisper.pos]] eyebrows in confusion.
p Go blinked. "Wait, I'm sorry, I think I misheard. Did you mean [[teal.subwas]] from the island or...[[teal.subwas]] an island?"
p "[[teal.Sub_is]] an island, Go. What you saw is all that's left." [[wisper.Sub]] turned and began to walk away, but then [[wisper.sub]] stopped and turned back, scratching [[wisper.pos]] chin. "Oh, and by the way -- I recall you mentioning you were saved by a Taronian earlier today. Did you happen to catch their name?"
p [[go.Sub]] felt Phi's grip on [[go.pos]] wrist tighten.
